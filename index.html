	<h1>Welcome to the Rabbit's world</h1>
	<p>Rabbits are social creatures and most want other rabbits around for companionship so consider adopting a bonded pair! To express happiness, bunnies will sometimes jump around and flick their heads and feet. That adorable behavior is known within the rabbit community as a “binky.”  If you already have a rabbit but want to add another to your brood, talk to your vet or the shelter about the best way to introduce bunnies to each other.  </p>
