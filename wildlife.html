	<p>Communication is really important for rabbits and, while they might not be as vocal as a cat or a dog (although grunting, growling, snorting and hissing generally means they’re not happy), they have plenty to say, you just have to learn how to speak bunny...</p>
	<p>Before adding a new pet to your family, it’s important to consider how the animal will get along with your existing pets. For example, you may wonder if your dog will get along with a new bunny. Likewise, you may expect conflict between your long-time rabbit companion and an excitable new puppy. One is obviously a prey animal and the other a predator.

Domestic rabbits and dogs can live together. However, this requires bonding the two animals through consistent exposure in a safe environment. This will train your canine to resist its hunting instincts when around the rabbit. If possible, you should also choose a dog with a low prey drive. Even after training, you will still need to constantly supervise your dog when it roams free with a rabbit.

By selecting the right dog, you can lessen the chances of it lapsing in its training. The most important step will be creating a firm bond between the two animals. This will make your rabbit less prone to fleeing and your dog less prone to hunting.</p>
